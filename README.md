## Requirements

* Xcode 9 or later
* iOS 11.0 or later

## Usage

There are two primary view controllers in this library: `TabViewController` and `TabViewContainerViewController`.
A `TabViewController` contains an array of tabs, a visible tab, and some methods to add and remove tabs. A `TabViewContainerViewController` contains `TabViewController`s.

It's not necessary to use a `TabViewContainerViewController`, but it's suggested, as it allows for split screen on iPad.

To get started, take a look at the public API for both classes, and look at the sample app for an example of how to use both.
At a minimum, you must subclass or instantiate a `TabViewController`, and add and remove tabs from it using its `activateTab(_:)` and `closeTab(_:)` methods.

## Installation

### Carthage

To install TabView using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add the following line to your Cartfile:

```carthage
github "IMcD23/TabView" "master"
```

### Submodule

To install TabView as a submodule into your git repository, run the following command:

```bash
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/IMcD23/TabView.git Path/To/TabView
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then, add the `.xcodeproj` in the root of the repository into your Xcode project, and add it as a build dependency.

### ibuild

A Swift static library of this project is also available for the ibuild build system. Learn more about ibuild [here](https://github.com/IMcD23/ibuild)

### Swift Package Manager

It is also possible to use the Swift Package Manager which is nativly supported in Xcode. See the documentation from [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) for adding dependencies to your project.
